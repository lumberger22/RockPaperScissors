# RockPaperScissors

This project is to make a little game of Rock Paper Scissors using some javascript skills I am learning at the moment to incorporate with the HTML and CSS I have learned so far. The project will be made in 2 parts: the logic and the GUI. For now, I will be making the logic with javascript and then coming back later to append it with the GUI portion.

UPDATE: I am back now to create the GUI and functionality using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I will be using the knowledge I have gained so far in js to create the game functionality on the screen and through the buttons available to the user.
